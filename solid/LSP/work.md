# Liskov Substitution Principle

> "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." [3]

> "Objects should be replacable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program." [4]

> "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but needs batteries, then you probably have the wrong abstraction." [4]

> "Tell, don't ask." [4]


### Relation to OCP

Martin's punchline: OCP helps to increase maintainability. LSP helps to adhere to OCP.


## Thoughts

- Pretty much resonates with the motivation for OCP
- In [3] Martin explains that in c++ inheritance is used to implement polymorphism and abstraction. He then says that the LSP is to get inheritance right.
- [Liskov rembers ]
- George [4] claims that TDA was part of the concept. Seems not to be true.
